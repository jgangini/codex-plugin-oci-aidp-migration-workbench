# Oracle memory and external framework guidance

## Responsibility boundaries

AIDP Migration Workbench defines the development/test/publication standard.
The installed official Oracle Workbench Engineer Agent handles supported live
operations. Upstream LangChain/LangGraph skills supply framework guidance;
they are a separate installation, not vendored Oracle integration.

Check whether those skills are available before recommending them. Use graph
fundamentals, persistence or human review only for the relevant change;
LangChain fundamentals/dependencies are optional when the implementation needs
them. The local `langchain-skills-codex` adapter packages five unmodified MIT
upstream skills with explicit activation. It is not an official Codex plugin
published by LangChain. Other supported official skill installations are valid;
do not require that particular local adapter.

Before using upstream guidance, verify the installed AIDP package versions and
Oracle runtime lifecycle. Oracle's current Agent Creation documentation lists
LangGraph 1.0.1; do not infer every compute has that exact version or override
platform packages from requirements. Preserve existing supported graph/agent
constructors, setup/invoke hooks, async/streaming behavior, selected OCI model,
guardrails and secret bindings. Generic MUST/ALWAYS, latest-version, provider,
database or tracing examples are not authority to migrate them.

Do not enable external LangSmith tracing or send conversation/evidence outside
approved destinations by installing a skill. Do not replace Oracle persistence
with an example database. Retry policies, replay and interrupt/resume do not
provide exactly-once external effects: use the existing budget/idempotency
ledger and reconcile uncertain paid starts. Skill invocation authorizes none
of these side effects by itself.

## Oracle-managed memory

According to Oracle, Context configures conversational memory and history
limits by messages/tokens. Multi-agent executors can be stateless, private or
shared, with different visibility. Stored Memory controls long-term extraction,
the extraction model/region, session sharing and retention. Cross-session
sharing applies to sessions initiated by the same user; it is optional.
Automatic summarization reduces older context near the model's context limit,
but is distinct from session retention and may lose exact details.

Before changing memory, establish the intended user/session scope, persistence
owner, history/token limits, extraction model cost, approved retention and test
environment. Inspect actual settings instead of assuming defaults. Do not
enable sharing, delete stored sessions or apply a retention change as a side
effect of improving a prompt. Use supported Oracle operations; never delete
shared provider tables directly.

Keep user preferences, research evidence/cache freshness and workflow
checkpoints distinct. Memory may justify suggesting a recurring query; only
an accepted schedule and an actual scheduler can initiate later runs. Reuse of
stored evidence must expose freshness and preserve source references.

## Focused memory tests

Test continuity within one session, the configured new-session behavior for
the same authenticated user, and isolation from another authenticated user.
Check supervisor/executor visibility when applicable. Exercise context overflow
and summarization without treating a summary as exact evidence. Check the
configured retention policy on disposable authorized data, without shortening
production retention or deleting real history merely for a test. Verify resume
does not duplicate external writes or charges. Report extraction/model/storage
costs separately and leave missing measurements unknown.
